In the above config file

1)source types  : netcat/telnet/ log/exec
2)channel types : memory / file
3)sink types    : hdfs/jms/logger/kafka topics


1)source types:
  i)netcat/telnet : console user typed streams
  ii)log          : to stream events from log data of remote servers,the logs can be os logs,database logs,web logs
  iii)exec        : to stream output of command line submissions of linux/unix
     ex: hadoop file i want to stream then
         source type=exec


2)channel types:
   i)memory: means buffering in RAM
   ii)file : means bufering in DISK

3)sink types :
    i)Hdfs     :to write into hadoop(hdfs)directory , the directory should already be existed
    ii)jms     :to write into non-hadoop applications
    iii)logger :to write events into console
     iv)kafka   :to write into kafka topics
